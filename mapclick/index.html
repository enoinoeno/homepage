            <h2>Passion Project(s)</h2>
    
            <p>I loved working on the passion project! I enjoyed making two versions of the page and experimenting with the color schemes. It is visually my most cohesive project this semester, but it was also the easiest. I would definitely add to this project to put people onto my favorite artists.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
    
            <p>Actually, I lied. The structure project was my favorite. I enjoyed making it interactive with the invisible links. I wish I could have made a more intriate attatching page for the links and added more surprise elements for the users. All in all this project was fun although it took me forever to figure out how to make the links invisible (thank you professor :) ) </p>

            <h2>Screensaver</h2>
    
            <p>I feel like this project was my most aesthetically pleasing. Although the end result isn't what I had sought after in the beginning (is it ever?), I had fun experimenting with animation for the first time. This project really opened doors for me in the terms of website design and accessibility. The more exposure I get in this class the more understanding I gain of web design processes (which is obviously the point lol but it's still cool to feel my mind open up in real time when I see or learn something new) </p>

            <h2>Accordian</h2>
    
            <p>The accordian project was fun to learn, because I had never thought of changing the web browser size for more interaction. I knew there would be different sizes needed for different devices (ipads, phones, TVs, etc.), but I had never seen it used on just a laptop browser. The websites Aidan showed us fpr inspiration were also very cool to discover. I wonder if theres a way to change sounds by browser size too? Lol there probably is!</p>

            <h2>Control</h2>
    
            <p>At first glance this project is not too bad, just clearly unfinished. I had most difficulty this semseter with creating buttons. I was very excited to try out using thes buttons, and it proved frustrating at times, but I did learn a lot about what buttons can do in the process. This project definitely had the most time spent on it besides my final. I learned a lot about troubleshooting probelms, div classes, buttons, and how complex interactive processes are broken down. I definitely learned the most with this project!

            <h2>Final</h2>
    
            <p>The final has been the most time consuming project for me this semester, but suprisingly not the most difficult. I tried adding more personal elements like drawn images and added a theme as weel. Ideally the final would be an interactive treasure map with the reflections and links to the projects as items and places on the map. This project was also a lot of fun to play around with and it was fun to try to navigate this myself. I also tried a lot of new things with this like an improved bezier curve and a spinning loading screen.
