        <h2>August 24th, 2023</h2>

        <p>Technology is everywhere. Whether we are referring to devices like laptops, phones, or even microwaves. What we have to be careful about is excluding the things that make our lives easier each day. Just like technology is everywhere, technology is everything. Just because a device doesn’t have a motherboard or a display, doesn’t mean it is not, in fact, technology. Oxford defines technology as, “machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.” This means that things we usually overlook, like brooms, lighters, mirrors, and even chopsticks, are all technology. While I do understand how some of these things can become overlooked, I feel that it is important to acknowledge all the advances we’ve made in order to continue moving forward in science and technology.
            As I read Laurel Schwulst’s article on websites, I became somewhat excited to create my website. I realized that I too had a limited view of what a website was. Now that I have more of an understanding of what a website is and what it could be, I feel like it’s definitely worth exploring!</p>

        <p>J.R. Carpenter's Handmade Web made me think about the longevity of the internet as well as the future of personaized digital media. he touches on how he no longer had access to his cartride from 1995, but the webpage he designed is still there. How are we so sure that what we have now will be able to be accessed later? This may not be a valid fear on one hand, because I can't imagine losing these kinds of spaces on a large scale without the indoctrination of some internet regulating legislation. The fear is that we already may have the ball rolling oin this. I remember hearing about net neutrality and things like that...I wonder if down the line there will be more regulation. I'm not for hypervigilance on the inernet, but I do wish there was a way to regulate some damagaing communities (like ED twitter :( ) that do damage to those in susceptible mind sets.</p>

        <p>I always thought my brothers were so smart because they are interested in the intricate workings of computers and technology. Both my brothers enjoyed things like programming/coding and building computers in their teenage years. As I grew up though, I realized that the same application they made their computers with is the same application I do my art with. I research, observe, and try out different systems until I reach a favorable end. It is interesting to see how the reading compared building computers to cities as well. In the end, it seems like the natural world reflects itself in technology. Because at the end of the day, it's just about processes and application. But we already knew that...? Subconsiously...</p>

        <h2>September 21st, 2023</h2>

        <p>The connection between writing and texting has always been interesting to me. The way you can almost hear the person you are interacting with, but can still get tone misinterpreted. On top of that I, personally, am not a texter or over-the-phone kind of person. I prefer to  communicate in person and it kind of drains me online. I also am the kind of person to not respond fast. I've gotten better though...lol. This is also interesting to me because it kind of reflects the shortened attention span of this generation/society. Yes it is rude to reply 4 hours late (I've learned..), but some people are very vocal about their 5 minute preffered response time. I think my thing is, when communtication is online, I can prioritize it. I can schedule it for when I am emotionally available to interact with people. In person though, I never feel like I am not emotionally available to talk...I'm just not sure what it is. </p>

        <h2>October 12th, 2023</h2>

        <p>This piece made me think of User Interface/User Experience design. This is exactly the field I want to go into! It was intersting to see how these different tools are used in these pages and installations. This class has most definitely opened my eyes when it comes to formatting and different ways to present online. The different websites and readings we venture into always make me reconsider how we use the internet and how there is no way we are "supposed" to interact with it.</p>

        <h2>October 19th, 2023</h2>

        <p>I think this reading just makes me realized that improvement and maintenence can happen on a smaller scale and still be effective. Obviously when it comes to pollution, it's major corprations who have the most damaging impact, but still package the issue as "We need to recycle more!" or "Remember to turn off the faucet while you brush your teeth!" On the contrary, these are effective. It would just be more of an impact if these large corporations would stop lobbying for legislation that gives them the legal leeway to destroy our ecosystem and repackage it to us as "everbody's fault". But I digress... When Abbe talks about a utopia and limit growth, smaller scale maintenence becomes more plausible. Even Fukuoka's "do nothing" farming technique and approach to agriculture and working with nature is a testament. It would just be easier if everyone did their part...Everyone</p>

        <h2>October 26th, 2023</h2>

        <p>It's interesting to think if how the internet and social media has evolved from a tool into another space of living. It really makes you think about how many different kinds of people there are in the world and how some choose to interact online. We can see how in our modern day people use the internet as salary, communication, and...life... I've come to the conclusion that social media is supposed to brainwash the masses. Whether it be on purpose or not (I'm not sure about any conspiracies). The constant pull back to your phone and away from reality makes people forget about how real experiences from the real world can change people's lives in real time. It's crazy, because as someone who grew up in a small, quiet town, I didn't realize this until I came to univeristy in the city. Maybe it's what people call "being young" but everyone literally has the world in their hands and at their feet. It's easy to get stuck online, but real world experiences take the cake every single time.</p>
